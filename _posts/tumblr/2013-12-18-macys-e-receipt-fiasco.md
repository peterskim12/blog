Today I received an email from Macy’s that was an e-receipt for a purchase of $640 diamond jewelry from a Macy’s store in Homestead, PA by someone with the same name. I think the response from an average person would be of concern that a fraudulent transaction just occurred, so I don’t think I’m overreacting here. 


The first thing I did was to call the Macy’s store. The first time I called, I was transferred to someone who didn’t pick up, so I left a message explaining the situation. After a few minutes of thinking about it, I thought if this really was fraud or even worse, identity theft, I should really figure out what’s going on. I called the Macy’s store a second time and demanded I speak with someone who could help me. I was transferred to a very helpful woman who took the receipt number and went to the register to try to track down the transaction. After about an hour, she called back to inform me that there was a possibility that this was a fraudulent transaction and I should check my credit card account, credit reports, etc. to look for suspicious activity.

At this point, I’m extremely concerned. Normally, it wouldn’t be a big deal for me to just request credit reports to make sure someone hasn’t opened a credit account with my information — fortunately, it’s easy to get these immediately online. However, I’m in the process of purchasing a home and my mortgage lender just told me a couple days ago that I should do my best to refrain from having my credit checked. 

I thought about waiting until tomorrow to get some advice from my mortgage lender since it was already 9:30pm but then I thought if someone is using my social security number to open credit card accounts, I need to take care of this ASAP. I decided to go ahead and request credit reports from all three agencies. 

Fortunately, it doesn’t look like there’s any suspicious activity which is the good news. However, I am still appalled that Macy’s e-receipt system would allow this to happen. I haven’t talked to my mortgage lender yet (will do so tomorrow morning) but I really hope this doesn’t screw up my mortgage application. Macy’s — if this fiasco messes up my mortgage application, you owe me a home. And I’m not kidding. 

When I searched on Google for ‘macy’s e-receipt’, it looks like this isn’t the first time this has occured:

This is absolutely ridiculous. I am never going to shop at Macy’s again.
