I noticed this book on sale at Amazon:

*Why Men Hate Going to Church by David Murrow*

[http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005VHBQSM/](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005VHBQSM/)

I almost bought it since it was only $2.99 but then I decided to do some research. Unfortunately, it sounds like he’s a typical complimentarian who believes that men should be leading the church. To be fair, I haven’t read any of his books and this statement is based on some very quick Googling, so please forgive me if my representation of Mr. Murrow and his opinions are incorrect.

It’s unfortunate, because most of the churches I’ve attended recently just don’t have a lot of men and I’d like to figure out how to make church more attractive to men. Is there really something fundamentally wrong with most American churches that make them boring to most men? I don’t want to believe that the way to draw more men to the church is by giving into cultural stereotypes about men and their interests. I don’t think hosting cigar smoking, poker playing, and motorcycle riding events addresses the core issue with why men aren’t going to church.

Also, I consider myself an egalitarian. Is it possible to be both egalitarian and yet want to find ways to make the church more interesting to men? Most of the “pro-man” pastors seem to promote a hyper-masculine version of Christianity that I don’t necessarily agree with. I believe the church can be a place where both men and women can lead and serve equally. It’s unfortunate that some men feel like a church can only be “pro-man” at the expense of giving leadership opportunities to women.
