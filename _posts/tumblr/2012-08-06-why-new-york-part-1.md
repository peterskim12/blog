A lot of people I know who live in New York are not native New Yorkers. Most of them come from rural or suburban upbringings. The consensus view is that New York is a great place to live while you’re young and single, but once you get married and start having kids, you should move to the suburbs or at least a smaller city with less population density.

That’s a perfectly fine opinion to have. We all have our preferences on what life should be like. However, I’d be sad if people felt resigned to leave New York after they have kids just because that seems to be the consensus view, instead of a sincere preference for living somewhere other than New York.

I will attempt to write a series of posts on why I love New York and would ideally love to raise my family here long term.

**Diversity**

The factor that sets New York apart from every other city in America and potentially the world is the extreme degree of ethnic and cultural diversity. 

I grew up on the North Side of Chicago. My mom used to take my sister and I on walks down Devon Ave. First, we’d pass through the Pakistani/Indian section with the aroma of Indian spices wafting through the air. Shop windows displayed colorful saris. A few blocks later, we’d enter the Jewish section of the street with its numerous bakeries. We were a short drive from the pockets of Korean communities on the north side on Lawrence Ave, Foster Ave, and Lincoln Ave. 

We moved to the suburbs when I was in middle school. The middle school I attended was predominantly black. There were maybe just a handful of Asians in the entire middle school. My high school experience was even more interesting — student population was about 45% black, 45% white, the rest mostly Hispanic, with very few Asians.

Ideally, this is type of diversity that I want my children to grow up in. America is getting more and more diverse. Just recently, the number of “minority” baby births overtook the number of white baby births for the first time. The world is also becoming more connected and what happens in countries on the other side of the world will become more important. I firmly believe that my children will be more successful if they learn how to interact with people of different ethnic, cultural, and religious backgrounds. Even more importantly, I believe that interaction makes our life experience so much richer than if we to just “stick with our own kind” or assume the majority culture.

I went to college in Cleveland and lived in Boston for 7 years. One of the reasons why I chose not to stay in Cleveland or Boston was that I was dissatisfied with the ethnic and cultural diversity I found in those cities. Boston lacks the ethnic neighborhoods that define cities like Chicago and New York. I also tried living in DC for 10 months. Someone told me that they appreciated the diversity in DC because they thought it was more “integrated” than a city like New York. Statistically, cities like Chicago and New York may be very segregated but I wouldn’t necessarily agree that segregation is always a bad thing. “Integration” often occurs when minorities essentially join white culture. It’s hard to find true “integration” where there is equal respect and recognition of both majority and minority cultures. In many ways, I’d rather be in a more segregated city where minority communities retain their distinct cultures than be in an “integrated” city where minority cultures have been whitewashed.

Queens County, which is synonymous with the Borough of Queens, is the most diverse county in America. From Wikipedia:

>According the 2010 Census, 39.7% (27.6% Non-Hispanic White) of the population was White, down from 91.5% in 1960, 19.1% Black or African American, 22.9% Asian, 12.9% from some other race, and 4.5% of two or more races. 27.5% of Queens’s population was of Hispanic or Latino origin (of any race).

In fact, it’s not just the most diverse county in America. Also from Wikipedia:

>Queens is the most ethnically diverse urban area in the world with a population of over 2.2 million, 46% of whom are foreign-born, representing over 100 different nations and speaking over 138 different languages.

So basically, if living in an ethnically diverse area is important to you, you won’t find any better place to live than New York City, and specifically Queens.

It’s been fun exposing Raf to all sorts of ethnic foods while we’ve lived in Queens: falafel, Chinese pastries (e.g. roast pork buns!), Greek food (moussaka, spanikopita), Bosnian food, Mexican, etc. As we meet people in the neighborhood, I’m hoping that our experience goes deeper than just partaking in the food of other cultures.
