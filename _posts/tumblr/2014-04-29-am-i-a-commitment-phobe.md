I had a conversation with someone recently about my various moves (from Queens, NYC to DC back to Queens, then to Hoboken) and my various job changes and he half-jokingly implied that I was a commitment-phobe. I think it’s easy to read me that way on the surface. I don’t want to come across as being overly defensive and I’m perfectly willing to admit that I really am a flake. However, I’d like to think that I’m just someone who is constantly in pursuit of something “better”. Something I can believe in. Something that ignites my passions.

There’s a fine line between constant change due to having a healthy pursuit of the ideal and being a “flake”. I remember reading a book in an economics class during college called Exit, Voice and Loyalty — the concepts behind the book seem obvious but I think it’s an extremely helpful way to think about engagement level of consumers or members of an organization. It’s also a helpful way to think about your own personal decision making process regarding whether to leave your job, church, neighborhood, city, etc. or stay to try to make it better. It’s critical for organizations to weigh the decisions of people to exit or voice equally instead of discrediting everyone who leaves or seem to like “making a fuss” all the time while favoring the opinions of those who stay “loyal”. 

It’s never a good thing to jump ship right away. I believe the best things in life are worth fighting for. I’ve been married for almost 10 years and while it certainly hasn’t been perfect, it’s been an amazing journey that I’m glad I’ve stuck with instead of quitting when it got difficult. Here are some suggestions for what to do when you think you may want to leave a job, relationship, church, city, etc.:

1) The fact is that you will experience change due to your surrounding environment and this is a beautiful aspect of the human experience. You should not be afraid of having to change. Do not try to find a job/relationship/church/city that fits you exactly right away because you will never find that. Do try to open your heart and mind to have a different experience as a result of being a part of this environment.

2) Engage and provide feedback in a constructive manner. Healthy organizations should be open to new ideas and you don’t want to make the mistake of assuming that the organization or system you are currently a part of is inflexible. 

Even after opening up to changing yourself and providing feedback, you will often realize that you need to leave. You’ve made a sincere attempt to open yourself to new ideas but it still just doesn’t click. Or you’ve made your best efforts to engage and contribute via constructive efforts and either the leadership isn’t willing to listen or isn’t willing to try your ideas. At this point, you can and perhaps should leave. Neither side needs to take this personally. 

I never want to be satisfied with the status quo and you shouldn’t either. This doesn’t mean your life needs to be constantly filled with discontentment. Be content with everything that’s good in your life and grateful for life itself but hunger and thirst for more.
