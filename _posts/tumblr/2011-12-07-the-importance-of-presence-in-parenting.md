I’ve written a lot of posts in the past about baby gear. I think I write about baby gear because 1) I admit, I’m a “shopper” and I love evaluating pros and cons of various competing products and 2) it’s a relatively non-personal way to talk about being a parent. Most of the popular parenting books also seem to focus on the superficial stuff related to parenting — making sure you have all the right gear, sleep training, breast feeding, transitioning to solid food, etc. I’m sure there are parenting books that focus more on the emotional and psychological issues related to raising children, but they’re certainly not among the best sellers.

Raf is almost 15 months now. He walks fairly well and is starting to show a lot more personality. He doesn’t talk yet, so he’s a little slow in that area. But he seems to have rhythm (so maybe he’ll be a musician!) and in general, he’s a good boy.

I’m not an expert in parenting. I only have one child. I haven’t read a lot of books on parenting. I haven’t taken any courses on child psychology. But my gut instinct and the values that have been formed over the 33 years of my life have resulted in my parenting philosophy to be defined as follows: physical presence and affection are the most important things that a parent can give to a child. Everything else is secondary to “being there” for your child and physically expressing your love for your children.

What does this mean practically? For my career, this means taking jobs that don’t require frequent travel and have reasonable hours. I certainly love what I do for work (on most days), but nothing gives me as much joy and satisfaction as holding my son and seeing him do something new or completely unexpected. For our family life, this means choosing to make the sacrifices necessary so that either my wife or I can stay at home full-time, or close to full-time, with our son (and future children).

To be fair, I have to admit that I’ve been very blessed and fortunate to be in a field where our family can live reasonably well off of a single income and not have to work crazy hours. But at the same time, there is no shortage of material goods and services that demand our time and money that can easily eat up budgets of people at any income level. Except for the very poor, I think most families have the ability to consider the possibility of a 1 income household, even if that means making significant sacrifices.

That’s where the challenge lies — what do we *really* need to provide for our children in order for them to grow up happy and well-adjusted and how much does it cost to provide that to them? Do our children need to attend private school? Do our children need to live in a particular school district (and thus require living in an expensive city or neighborhood)? Do our children need to be involved in expensive extra-curricular activities? I believe all these questions can be more easily answered if you have a focused vision or philosophy on how you want to raise your children and what you want your family life to look like.

For me, providing physical presence and affection to my children is more important than making sure they attend private school or the best public school system in the area. So I’m not going to kill myself working a job with long hours that takes me away from my child just to support private school tuition. I’m not going to ask my wife to work so that we can pay the mortgage on the expensive house in the “best” school district. My children will attend schools that are good enough and if they’re geniuses, I’m sure they’ll find their way to an Ivy League university.

You may argue that it’s not an issue of either-or — that you can raise children who understand that they are loved by their parents AND have your ideal career that requires you to travel. Or that both parents can work full-time jobs to support all the educational opportunities you want to provide for your children and not have them feel neglected.

I don’t want to take that risk. I want to do whatever I can to minimize the risk of my children growing up feeling unloved by their father and mother. I’m sure there are plenty of cases of fathers who try to spend a lot of time with their children but still have the kids turn out hating them. At the same time, I don’t think we are totally unable to determine how our kids turn out. I am going to put my bet on the idea that being physically present for my children is going to make the greatest difference in their lives.

I think this is challenging for some fathers. I hear of a lot of dads who invest in their career because providing for their children is their way of loving their kids. My father spent a lot of time at work because he wanted to provide the best for me and my sister. I understand that now. But as a child growing up, I wanted to see my father more. I wished he didn’t work as much. I don’t want my son to grow up feeling that way.

Being physically affectionate to your children is hard for some fathers. But try. And keep trying. I believe all children want their mothers and fathers to be physically affectionate with them.
