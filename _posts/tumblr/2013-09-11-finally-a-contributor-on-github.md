Being an active contributor to a public project on GitHub seems to have become one way to prove that you are sufficiently geeky; a lot of software engineering job listings these days even seem to make that a requirement! However, besides starting my own public repository to contribute code to, I’m not sure I’d feel completely comfortable doing so with some random interesting project out there. 

One thing I like about how MarkLogic operates is that we leverage existing public developer communities such as Stack Overflow and GitHub to promote open and collaborative discussion/development related to MarkLogic. My previous employer took a more closed approach by hosting their own forums site and not making source code as readily available. 

All this to say that I’m happy to announce that some contributions I made to a public GitHub repository are now available on its master branch. Roxy is a lightweight framework for building easily maintainable, deployable XQuery applications on MarkLogic Server. I fixed a couple of minor bugs and added two new features:

I’m not much of a Ruby programmer but since Roxy is largely written in Ruby, I had to roll up my sleeves and figure out some of the strange syntactical quirks in Ruby. Ruby string interpolation is kinda neat but threw me off the first time I saw it.

I also had to give myself a quick refresher on Bash script programming for the last new feature I added.

Looking forward to contributing more to the Roxy project and perhaps this will give me the confidence to contribute to other projects on GitHub.
