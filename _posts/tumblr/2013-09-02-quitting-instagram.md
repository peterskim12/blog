I’ve “quit” Instagram a number of times now. Each time, I would delete the app from my phone and go a couple of weeks before getting the itch to see what my friends have been posting on Instagram and re-install the app.

Each time I quit, the reason was pretty much the same — I’m not saying this is everyone’s motivation for using Instagram but I knew, at least for myself, that posting photos on Instagram was mostly about saying “Hey, check out where I am and/or what I’m doing.” Not that there’s anything inherently wrong with that — I just don’t want that to be the reason why I take photographs. I don’t want to take photographs with an audience in mind because that often colors the type of photographs I choose to take.

You can find my photos on Flickr:

The majority of my recent photos are of my family and they are marked as viewable only to Flickr “Friends” and “Family” but I’m trying to spend more time taking non-family photographs which are marked Public.
