Maybe it’s just the particular news sources I read but I feel like every other article these days has to do with housing in some way. The “affordable housing problem”, gentrification, mortgages, real estate, etc. I think being a second-generation immigrant gives me a particular perspective on the idea of “home” that I don’t think a lot of Americans’ whose families have been here (and especially, in a particular town) for 3, 4, 5+ generations have.
 
My parents emigrated from South Korea to the United States in 1977. They were recently married, had blue collar jobs but wanted more opportunity than they saw in their future if they stayed in Korea. It wasn’t as difficult for my father because his brothers and sisters were emigrating at the same time, but for my mother, she was leaving everything and everyone she knew. Neither of them spoke English very well and they didn’t have much money. They’ve been in the US for almost forty years now and while they’ve been here longer than they lived in Korea, do they consider America to be their home? My father still has not returned to Korea to visit since he left in 1977; there’s no way he would consider Korea to be “home” either. 

I lived in Chicago from the time I was born until I went to college in Cleveland, Ohio. Since college, I’ve lived in Boston, Northern Virginia, and New York (with a couple of short stints in London). Do I consider Chicago to be home? I haven’t lived there since I was 18 and don’t plan on moving back there. Do I consider New York to be my home? Maybe but not in the same way that many “locals” do. 

A lot of people have an expectation of “home” to have some degree of permanence, but maybe that’s unrealistic or even unhealthy. I certainly believe housing affordability is a very real problem but to some extent, it implies that these people who are priced out of their “home” have a right to call that particular neighborhood/city/state “home”. Is that fair?

I consider myself extremely blessed to be able to live in close proximity to what I believe is the greatest city in America, New York. I am also very proud to live in the great little town of Hoboken, New Jersey, which in many ways is an urbanist’s ideal city. But if I ever have to leave this area because rents or property taxes get too high, would I respond angrily about being forced out of my “home”? 

One thing I’ve learned from being a child of an immigrant is to not be afraid to relocate to pursue opportunity and happiness. Instead of tying myself down to a physical “home” and all the comforts of staying put, I’ve learned to create a state of “home” regardless of where I am physically by leaning on faith, friends and family.
