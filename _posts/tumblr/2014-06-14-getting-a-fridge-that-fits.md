When we moved into our new place a few months ago, we knew most of our appliances were old but weren’t sure when we’d need to replace them. As far as we knew, they were all functional, which is good enough for now. 

However, we discovered the freezer part of our fridge wasn’t keeping our ice cream cold enough. With the summer upon us, I didn’t want to not be able to eat ice cream! We could have 1) called an appliance repair person to see if something could be done to fix it or 2) just buy a new fridge. We decided against Option #1 because if it was fixable, it probably would have cost at least $100, and that’d be to fix a fridge that’s almost 20 years old and may have more problems in the near future. While that certainly would have been the cheaper option, if we had to get a new fridge in the next few years anyways, that’s $100+ spent just for kicking the can down the road.

When we decided to buy a new fridge, we didn’t realize that our options would be so limited by the space designated for the fridge in our small urban condo kitchen. Also, it wasn’t just the space limiting our choices — the oven and fridge are positioned in a way where if the fridge was too deep, we wouldn’t be able to open the oven door all the way. 

When it came down to it, we couldn’t get a fridge more than 28 inches wide and 28 inches deep. If you do some research, it’s actually quite difficult to find a fridge to fit those parameters. I think there are some small entry-level top-freezer fridges that would have fit, but we also wanted this to be an upgrade from our old fridge. 

We ended up getting this Summit Appliances bottom freezer fridge that got great reviews on Home Depot. While it’s much smaller than many of the “premium” fridges on the market, I think the smaller size will encourage us to not buy in bulk and buy only what we need for the next week or so. I really like how it looks in our kitchen — it makes a dated kitchen look so much better. It also makes a lot less noise than our old fridge.
