A friend of mine asked me today what I thought was the best coffee in Hoboken. I’ve only lived here for about 5 months but I’ve had the pleasure of trying out a bunch of the good coffee shops in town. Before I go on, I have to admit that I live in uptown Hoboken so I haven’t had a chance to try some of the good coffee shops downtown yet.

There isn’t an obvious answer to the question as to what’s the “best” coffee in Hoboken. I think Hoboken is fortunate to have a number of great coffee shops and it sounds like I moved here at just the right time since some of these shops opened just in the past year.
Here are some of my favorite coffee joints in Hoboken:

**modcup**

modcup is primarily a coffee roasting operation based in Jersey City Heights but they have a mobile coffee cart that is usually located on Sinatra Drive between 1st and 2nd Streets. Since they are primarily a roasting operation, they obviously use their own beans. They are extremely particular about every step in the coffee making process, from the sourcing of the raw beans to the roasting, then to the brew. 

I recently went up to their roasting facility in Jersey City Heights for a casual but extremely informative 1 hour brewing class. It’s obvious how passionate they are about making the absolute perfect cup of coffee. The class focused on the brewing process; while they do all they can to sell the best beans possible, bad brewing by the consumer can ruin all the hard work they put into making the perfectly roasted bean. They want their customers to know how to brew good coffee so they can appreciate properly roasted beans. 

I’ve gone to their cart twice and had their Ethiopian coffee both times. To be honest, I was a bit disappointed the first time; Travas was extremely busy at the time and used the Aeropress to brew it, which is a faster and more convenient brewing method. Fortunately, the next time I went, he was less busy and offered to brew it for me on the Chemex. According to Travas, African coffees tend to be fruitier; brewing them using a pour over method such as the Chemex or Hario will bring those high notes out much better than the Aeropress, which is better suited for Indonesian coffees and Central/South American coffees. The Ethiopian on the Chemex was much better, but knowing that he’s typically a one-man operation, I totally understand that he can’t do the pour over all the time.

He also specializes in making a cold brew concentrate which he sells in bottles. I had a sample of this during my trip to his roasting facility and it was so much more rich and flavorful than your typical iced coffee.

If your criteria for “best” coffee is focused purely on the coffee, I’d say modcup comes out on top. Just remember to ask for the Ethiopian on the Chemex; if he’s too busy to do a Chemex, get the Indonesian on the Aeropress. Also try out their cold brew when you can and buy a bag of beans to brew at home. I love the idea of supporting a local coffee roastery; it’s tempting to be sucked into the marketing of some of the more widely known artisan coffee roasters such as La Colombe, Stumptown, Blue Bottle, Counter Culture, etc. but if you take into account shipping time, storage, etc., you’re probably better off getting beans that were roasted locally.

**bwe kafe**

bwe (means “to drink” in Haitian Creole) kafe opened around the same time I moved to Hoboken; they’re located near the corner of 10th and Washington. Since I’ve been working from home more lately, it was great to hear about a new local cafe opening up. The space at bwe is absolutely beautiful. There’s a long table at the back, with smaller two-person tables from the middle to the front. They offer free wifi. The clientele is a mix of students, young professionals who seem to be working “at home” like me and moms getting a caffeine break.

They use La Colombe beans exclusively. One of the motivations for running the business is to help support the youth of Haiti. You can find their whole story here: http://www.bwekafe.com/story/. Back to the beans — I mention Haiti because La Colombe supplies bwe kafe with coffee beans from Haiti. They keep that as a permanent option and rotate another La Colombe single-origin coffee as another option. They’ve had a Columbian and Ethiopian in the past. 

You can get their hot coffee from a typical drip machine or via pour over. They use the Hario V60 drippers. Every cup of pour over coffee has been delicious. I understand their desire to support Haiti, but to be honest, the Haitian beans have been my least favorite of the La Colombe beans that they offer. The also do a Japanese slow drip for their iced coffee, which is very good.

If you want an amazing space to do some studying, work or meet with friends, support a business who dedicates a portion of their profits to kids in Haiti, along with a very good cup of coffee to go with it, I highly recommend bwe kafe. I would strongly suggest getting their pour over coffee instead of the drip. 

**Red Lion Coffee**

I believe Red Lion Coffee also opened just in the past year. Red Lion has an extremely small storefront on 14th St and Bloomfield. Inside, there’s a standing room only bar along the window and they have a few tables outside to sit when the weather’s nice, so this isn’t a place you’d go if you need a place to read/study/work or have a long conversation with a friend. It’s mostly a take out operation.

They also offer two brewing options for their coffee. I’m not sure if their “standard” is drip or french press; it might be the latter. Their other option is pour over. Their coffee is about a dollar more expensive than bwe kafe ($4 for a pour over here as opposed to $3 at bwe kafe).

I’ve only been here once and just had their standard coffee. It was very tasty. One nice thing about Red Lion is they get their pastries from Balthazar in Manhattan.

Red Lion is a great option if you live uptown around 14th Street and it’s on your way to the bus/ferry. They also have the best pastries of all the coffee shops.

This doesn’t provide a single, definitive answer to the question as to what’s the best coffee in Hoboken but fortunately we’ve got a lot of very good options that rival the quality and quantity of options in New York neighborhoods better known for their coffee such as Chelsea, Tribeca, Park Slope, Williamsburg, etc. 

I have yet to try Maroon and Empire Coffee which are more downtown, so I’ll have to write a “Part II” to this post after I’ve had a chance to visit those coffee shops. 

Why haven’t I mentioned Starbucks? There are 3 Starbucks in Hoboken. They’re perfectly fine options if convenience is your primary consideration but with so many better alternatives, why would you go to Starbucks when you really want a *good* cup of coffee? I think there’s also something to be said for supporting local, independently-owned businesses. If you absolutely have to go to a Starbucks, the one on Washington Street is probably the best since they have a Clover machine. While the Clover machine is capable of making an extremely good cup of coffee, it also makes the inferior quality of Starbucks beans/roast obvious since I’ve had Clover-brewed coffee at independently-owned coffee ships before Clover was acquired by Starbucks. I’ve already wasted too much blog-post-real-estate mentioning Starbucks…

In conclusion:

* modcup
* bwe kafe
* Red Lion Coffee
