I’m currently on the Amtrak from Washington, DC to New York. On my way to my first day at my new job. I love starting new jobs because those first 6-12 months are when I feel like I learn the most. Please wish me luck!

I didn’t get a good sense of closure from my last job. My last job really ended back in October when Oracle announced that they would be acquiring Endeca. I was inclined to think that I wouldn’t want to be around for much longer, but I honestly gave working at Oracle a legitimate shot. However, over the next few months, things played out the way I expected and I just wasn’t looking forward to staying there long term. The time from October to the present was sort of an IT job purgatory. I guess I should be grateful I had a well-paying job in a bad economy even though I just wasn’t thrilled about my job anymore.

After working at one place for almost five years, Endeca really became a part of my identity. One example is how I have an abnormally large amount of orange-colored items, including my orange suitcase and orange eyeglasses. I liked orange as a color prior to working at Endeca but I’m sure my employment there resulted in an increase in affinity for the color orange.

When you work for a private technology company, the vast majority of employees want the company to either go public or get acquired for a nice dollar amount someday, so in a lot of ways, I am extremely grateful that a company like Oracle saw the value in Endeca that came about through the efforts of hundreds of smart, hard-working people over the past 10+ years. At the same time, there is sadness in a company like Endeca essentially dying. As much as some folks may try to preserve and even evangelize Endeca’s culture and values to the rest of Oracle, it’s not hard to see this as a losing battle. You see this to some degree with the remnants of other Oracle acquisitions.

I loved working at Endeca. I loved my job so much that I wanted to do everything I could to make sure everyone else loved it too. I even took upon the responsibility of ordering snacks and soda for my office so that my coworkers got stuff they liked instead of whatever some HR person in another office wanted to send us. I responded to questions from customers on our company’s developer forums on my spare time because I loved helping people be successful in using Endeca. I also organized social events for our office. Most of all, I really enjoyed working with my colleagues… Not necessarily because they were the most brilliant people in the industry, though some of them definitely were. That didn’t matter to me. I valued my colleagues at Endeca because most of them were sincerely “good” people who usually did the “right” thing and valued people as people and not just as tools/resources to help them get their job done. When you spend 8-12 hours per day at work, you want to be with people who you like and trust and I had that at Endeca.

Anyway, it’s time to move on. Let’s just hope my new employer doesn’t get acquired by Oracle anytime soon. Or if it does, that I get filthy rich from it.
