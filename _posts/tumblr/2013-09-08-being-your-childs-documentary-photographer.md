Maybe I’m a bit obsessive with this photography thing. To be fair to myself, even though I’ve considered photography to be a hobby of mine for about ten years, I’ve never gone overboard with the gear — it certainly can become an expensive hobby. I currently have just one digital camera (with two lenses) and one film camera (with one lens).

I’m worried if I’m obsessive because I’ve taken over 570 frames in the first 8 days of this month, mostly photos of my kids. I’ve made it a goal to increase the number of quality photos I take every month — last month (August 2013), I beat my previous record by publishing 179 “quality” photos to Flickr. For this month, I’m easily on track to improve upon last month. Maybe there are some parents who have a higher rate of shooting than me but I don’t see a lot of parents with decent cameras at the playground, so I’m guessing there aren’t a lot who consistently shoot at such a high rate. 

I want to make sure that my children have a lot of photographs of themselves that they can look back on as they grow up. I sometimes wonder if this fear of not capturing moments, even the fairly mundane ones, is a modern phenomenon brought on by Instagram, Facebook, etc. and buying into the idea that if a moment isn’t captured, it never happened.  I see this as a nice gift I can give to my children and my future self.

In the end, you can always pay a professional photographer to take nicely staged portraits of you and your family but no one is going to be your child’s documentary photographer besides you. The vast majority of parents seem to try to get by with taking photos with their iPhone or other smartphone… it might work fine for outdoor photos when it’s nice and bright outside but it becomes woefully inadequate for indoor photos (you’ll get mostly blurry photos if not using flash or “deer in the headlights” photos if you use your flash).

If you want to start becoming more serious about being your child’s documentary photographer, here’s my personal opinion on what camera you should get/use. The vast majority of parents I know who get a digital SLR (and who aren’t already interested in serious photography) usually end up not using it because it’s too bulky, heavy and inconvenient. When we already have so much kids’ crap we need to carry with us, the last thing we want to do is to also schlep a massive camera around. Then they end up reverting to their iPhone and end up with crappy pictures. So my advice is to not buy a digital SLR.

There is a middle ground, which is the one I’ve chosen, and that is the mirrorless system camera. These are cameras that support interchangeable lenses, have much smaller/lighter camera bodies than digital SLRs and provide anywhere between 80-100% of the image quality that you’ll find in an entry-level to mid-tier digital SLR. I’m personally a big fan of the Micro Four Thirds system which Panasonic and Olympus both produce cameras and lenses for. The Sony NEX system is also very popular and well-regarded. I never feel like carrying my Panasonic DMC-GX1 is a burden and it’s easy to throw into your diaper bag or whatever other bag you’re carrying. If you have specific questions about these cameras, feel free to ask me.

It’s unfortunate that mirrorless system cameras haven’t done better in the United States (in contrast, it’s extremely popular in Asia). I think it’s the perfect camera for parents who care about photographing their kids.
