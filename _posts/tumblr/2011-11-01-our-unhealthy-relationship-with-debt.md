There are pros and cons to living in a society where we are able to borrow money to acquire things that we could not hope to save enough for in a short period of time. One example that almost everyone is familiar with is college education. What would happen if you were not able to take out student loans to cover tuition? We’d be forced to delay going to college until we (or our parents) saved up enough money to pay for it in its entirety in cash. Many people would just give up and not attend college. So it’s good that it’s so easy to take out student loans, right?

The answer is not so straight-forward. To some extent, college tuition is as expensive as it is because the ease in which one can take out a student loan has driven up demand. We’re in a vicious cycle where the government has made it easy for students to obtain loans, which drives up the cost of tuition, which in turn forces student to take out even greater loans that students are not able to pay off. If the end result is a large population of college graduates saddled with tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt, then is that really any better than if student loans were less available?

The same concept applies to housing. If home loans were not as easily available, people would have to rent for years or even decades before being able to save enough cash to buy a house outright. Since home loans are relatively easy to obtain, this drove up demand for housing, thus increasing house prices, thus causing people to take out greater loans to buy those homes… then when the bubble bursts, homeowners are saddled with a debt they can’t pay off.

Our society is obviously too dependent on debt but I also think it’s unrealistic to suggest that people should not be able to take out loans at all and that we ought to go back to “the way things used to be” when people paid for things in cash. I think there is a healthy middle ground where lenders are much more restrictive in who qualifies for loans. Yes this means lenders evaluating the likelihood of students being successful in their careers and being able to pay off their student debt before granting a student loan. Or lenders requiring home buyers to place a 20%+ down payment on the purchase before giving out a mortgage. And banks denying credit cards to people who can’t consistently pay their bills. This would have a huge impact on the economy and people would hurt for a long time but we are in desperate need for a correction.

We need to wake up and take a serious look at our aggregate personal and national debt. Does anyone really believe that this debt will ever be paid off? It’s just going to be passed onto one future generation after the next. It’s easy to look at Greece and Europe right now and consider ourselves fortunate to not be in their shoes. I don’t think we’re really that much better off though.
