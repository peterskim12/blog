The wife and I are great travel partners. We’ve had some great trips since we’ve been married — Montreal a few times, Portland, Seattle, Italy (Rome, Cinque Terre, Venice), Paris, London, etc. Traveling can be frustrating if your travel partners have different philosophies on how to plan (or not plan) the trip. There’s one extreme of the traveler who wants to plan the entire itinerary for the trip, down to exactly where he/she wants to be at specific times. Then you’ve got the other extreme of the traveler who doesn’t make any plans and stumbles around, hoping to bump into something interesting.

We fall pretty close to right in the middle of those two extremes. Generally, we’ll come up with a list of the sights and activities that seem interesting. We’ll rank those in order of priority. We’ll also group them by vicinity so that if we’re in a certain area, we’ll try to do/see as much as we can in that particular area in order to minimize on the travel time. However, we generally don’t come up with a specific timetable. Or if we do, it’s extremely rough. And in the end, neither of us consider it the end of the world if we don’t see or do something on the list — sure, we may have 1 or 2 “must see/do” items, but usually not 5-10. This philosophy gives us enough guidance to feel like we accomplish a lot by the end of our trip but at the same time, gives us the freedom to take spontaneous diversions in case we happen to stumble upon something interesting that wasn’t planned.

We tend to approach our life goals the same way. However, I feel like we’ve been operating in survival mode the past two years, since the birth of our first child in 2010 and our second in 2012. Being in survival mode has made it difficult for us to look towards the future and cast a vision for where we want to be 1, 3, and 5 years from now. But now that we’ve gotten into a bit of a groove with the two kids, I think we have a little bit of breathing room to take a step back and start thinking and talking about what we want to achieve as a family in the near to medium term future.

We’ll be considering different areas of our lives (financial, personal/career, relational, spiritual) and start talking through some goals we want to set as a family for each area at different time frames (e.g. 1 year out, 3 years out, 5 years out). Then perhaps every 6-12 months, we’ll evaluate how we’re progressing against those goals and tweak if necessary.

I think it’s critical to set goals for the future instead of just living in the now because it gives us the ability to be more strategic about what we want to do with our lives. It’s very hard to be strategic and intentional when you’re only focused on what you’re trying to accomplish today or this week.
