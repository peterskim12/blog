It’s been exactly four months since we moved from Astoria to Hoboken and so far, we’ve been loving it. The primary reason why we were looking to move was to improve our quality of life. This wasn’t necessarily about more comfort, more space, etc. We just found ourselves wasting a lot of time in our previous living situation doing things that are of little value to us — things like hand-washing dishes, going to the laundromat, traveling long distances for a decent park/playground, etc.

I recognize that in a place like New York City, it can be considered a bit snooty to say that I don’t want to “waste” time washing dishes, doing laundry, etc. when that’s how a lot of people in NYC live, but as a parent with two small children, time is precious — I would rather be spending my time at home with my children instead of doing chores.

Another way to describe the changes we made is to say that we were reducing the time spent in activities that are purely “overhead” or transactional in nature. It’s the responsibility of COOs and CFOs of companies to find ways to optimize their operations and finances so that time and money spent on “overhead” is reduced to an absolute minimum in order to maximize investment on value-add activities — I don’t think it’s necessarily a bad thing to approach our family/household lives in the same way.

In order to get started, you need to identify how you spend your time, then prioritize that list according to how much you truly value each activity. You can start with the bottom of that list and see which of your “low value” activities are actually consuming a significant amount of your time. 

To address some of our problems in our previous living situation, we certainly could have done things like pay for laundry service, hire a maid to come in regularly to do our dishes, take taxis more frequently to get to the nice playgrounds, etc. — very popular solutions amongst New Yorkers to make city life a bit less of a pain. In the end, we preferred taking on a change of scenery that we felt would be more than just band-aid solutions on a few specific annoyances of city life and would put us in a situation that was more conducive to the lifestyle we wanted to have in general. So when the opportunity became available to move to an apartment that was larger, had a washer/dryer in-unit, full-sized appliances (including dishwasher!) — all for less than what we would have paid for a similar place in Astoria, we jumped on it. Fortunately, we didn’t have to give up some of the most important characteristics of a city lifestyle — walkability/bikeability, relatively short commute to work, emphasis on public space, etc.

Four months in Hoboken and to be honest, it’s been great. There are things we miss about Astoria but overall, we have absolutely no regrets. The wife and I have clear consensus that our day to day lives have been greatly enhanced by this transition. That’s certainly been helped by quickly finding a lot of new friends through church and random encounters in our building and local playgrounds.
