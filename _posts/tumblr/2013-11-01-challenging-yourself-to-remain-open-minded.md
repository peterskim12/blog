Today is my birthday and I am now 35 years old. I can no longer honestly say I’m in my early 30s anymore. :( People in their 20s are still largely considered “young” by most standards — most people in their 20s haven’t gotten married and don’t have kids yet. If the age of 30 isn’t that tipping point between being “young” vs “old”, then the age of 35 is clearly on the “old” side, at least from my narrow perspective. :)

I’ve been married for almost a decade (!!!), have two young kids, and my hairline is starting to recede. I’m getting old. One way I need to continue challenging myself as I get older is to remain open-minded and be willing to try new things, consider new ideas, etc. 

Many people I know get stubborn and close-minded as they get older. I don’t know if human beings are just wired to be that way. Even if we are wired to become more set in our ways as we age, I believe we need to force ourselves to be comfortable with change and new ideas if we want to remain marketable. 

This may seem to go against common sense. We often spend significant amounts of time, money and energy investing in people, places, skills, etc. which become increasingly difficult to give up over time precisely because we’ve made such a huge investment in those things. However, I believe nothing forces people to grow as individuals more than intentionally (or unintentionally) imposing change upon our lives. I believe change is good.

Changing where you live forces you to open yourself up to new people/relationships.
Changing where you work forces you to learn how to be productive with a new group of colleagues, learn new skills, etc.

I hope people around me can continue encouraging me to pursue new experiences.
