It’s interesting how different strollers are popular in different cities. In New York, the Bugaboo is the stroller to get. We got a Bugaboo Bee because we thought it was the best fit for our lifestyle (no car, lots of walking and public transportation). However, when we moved to Alexandria, we noticed the most popular stroller here seemed to be the BOB Revolution. There are some great running trails around Alexandria which would make having a hard-core jogging stroller pretty useful and there are a lot of bumpy sidewalks so a stroller with large pneumatic wheels provides a more comfortable ride for baby.

The wife and I have been struggling with finding ways to exercise since the baby was born. She used to take classes regularly at the gym and I used to be fairly consistent with doing the treadmill at the gym. It gets a lot more difficult with the baby though. Even though we already had a fairly expensive stroller, we decided that if we didn’t get a jogging stroller, it’d just be difficult to fit exercise into our lives.

We went back and forth in trying to decide whether to get a bike trailer that could convert into a jogging stroller (something like the Chariot Cabriolet or the Burley Encore) or a dedicated jogging stroller. I’ve been wanting to get back into biking but I was trying to decide whether the baby had to be a part of that. We decided to get a jogging stroller for now, to run with the wife and baby for exercise but to bike for commuting to work and running errands. We may get something like the iBert or Bobike in the future if we decide we want to bike with the Raf but it’d be purely for recreational purposes. You’re not supposed to cycle for fitness with child in tow for safety reasons.

There are three types of jogging strollers:

1) **Jogging stroller style strollers:** these strollers look like jogging strollers but the manufacturers of these strollers actually recommend that you don’t use them for jogging. An example is the Baby Jogger City Mini. Why would anyone buy a stroller that looks like a jogging stroller but you can’t actually go jogging with it? I guess looking sporty or healthy is in?

2) **All-purpose jogging strollers:** these are strollers you can actually use for jogging but are also decent general use strollers. An example is the BOB Revolution or the Baby Jogger Summit XC. They allow you to lock the front wheel in place for when you go jogging (front wheel should always be locked when jogging for safety and performance reasons) or allow the front wheel to swivel when you need maneuverability for daily general use. These strollers sound ideal and they are if you don’t live in densely populated areas because these strollers tend to be larger than non-jogging strollers. I *rarely* saw a BOB Revolution in New York City… they’re just too big to bring into the tiny NYC grocery and retail stores.

3) **Jogging-specific strollers:** these are strollers that are intended to be used only for jogging and not for everyday use. The front wheel is permanently locked forward and the tires on these strollers tend to be skinnier for less rolling resistance compared to the all purpose jogging strollers. Examples are the BOB Ironman and the Baby Jogger F.I.T. 
We decided to get a jogging-specific stroller because we already had an everyday stroller. If we got something like the BOB Revolution, we probably would never use our Bugaboo anymore. 
I went on my first test run from our apartment to the grocery store to pick up some deli meat and lemon juice. There’s a nice little trail that runs along the Metrorail line, so the portion of the trip on that trail is about 0.75 miles each way. 1.5 miles usually is not a big deal for me at all, but I was dying on my way back home. Part of it is probably due to not having run in a couple of months but even then… running while pushing 45-50 pounds is not as easy as I expected. All that to say, it was definitely a good workout and I look forward to doing it regularly. For any mom or dad interested in losing weight, I’d highly recommend getting a jogging stroller — I don’t know how you can not lose weight if you run with the jogging stroller regularly.
