Raf loves greek yogurt. Why did we start feeding him greek yogurt instead of regular yogurt? I don’t know exactly. We read various articles saying greek yogurt has more nutritional benefits. We also lived in Astoria, a traditionally Greek neighborhood in New York City, so it was much easier to find full fat Greek yogurt than full fat regular yogurt.

In any case, he loves it. When we moved to Virginia, we noticed the local Trader Joe’s didn’t carry full fat versions of Fage, our preferred brand of Greek yogurt, but they did have a full fat version of their store brand Greek yogurt. We fed him that for a couple of weeks, but then we finally got around to going to Whole Foods and noticed the Fage yogurt was much better nutritionally than the Trader Joe’s stuff — less of the bad stuff, more of the good stuff.

So that’s my baby feeding tip of the day. Go with Fage over Trader Joe’s greek yogurt, even if it is a bit more expensive.
