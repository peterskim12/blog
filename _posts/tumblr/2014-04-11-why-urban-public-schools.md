When I hear other parents talk about their preferences for their children’s education, it mostly seems to focus on education. That’s perfectly reasonable since it seems clear that doing well in school, leading to admission to a top-tier undergraduate program which do a better job in preparing students for top-tier graduate and professional programs, will lead to careers with high salaries. And who doesn’t want their children to be successful and financially secure?

What I hear parents talking about less is giving their children an experience of having classmates who are of a different ethnicity, come from a different cultural background, or have different financial means. If you ask parents directly about this, most of them will probably say that this is a “nice to have” but in the end, isn’t going to make a significant difference in shaping their children’s character development. When it comes down to it, since we live in such a hyper-competitive world, we feel like not focusing purely on academics is taking too big of a risk in short-changing our children of potential future happiness (which in most cases means earning lots of money). 

The reason why I am such a strong proponent of sending my children to public schools, and specifically urban public schools, is that our society has become so stratified — racially, socially, economically — that there are very few institutions remaining where there are opportunities for people of different backgrounds to interact. It’s sad that even religious institutions, especially Christian churches, are mostly stratified along racial and economic lines — there’s that saying about how Sunday mornings are the most segregated time of the week in America. Schools, especially, urban public schools, are one of the few institutions in which we have the opportunity to engage with people who are different from us and for that engagement to not just enrich our own life experiences but also be life-changing for those we interact with.

This article in Christianity Today about a family sending their kids to the poorest public school in their city continues to inspire me and challenge me. It encapsulates my own reasons for why I believe in sending our children to our local public school.

This quote sums up the attitude that I wish all parents had when thinking about their children’s school decision:

>“I began to make decisions about my children’s lives in a different way. What if I didn’t only think about the fabulous life I could make for my three? What if I stood up for not only what was good for mine, but was good for all?”

To be fair, my situation is nowhere near as dire as that of this author’s. I live in Hoboken, New Jersey where the median household income is over $100,000 and almost 90% of the city’s population is white or Asian. However, the demographics of the Hoboken Public Schools are very different. There is a very high percentage of students who are eligible for free lunch and whites are the minority in every school in the district. Greatschools.com ratings are low for most of the schools primarily because test scores are low. 

A parent can look at the situation and make one of three decisions: 1) enroll their children in private school where their children will presumably be challenged more, 2) move to the suburbs where the schools are more socio-economically homogenous (predominantly skewing towards wealthier backgrounds) or 3) choose to engage in the public school system. Many parents choose option 1 or 2 because they don’t believe public schools can be improved to an acceptable level. And I would agree that as an individual parent/family, you probably cannot change public schools for the better on your own. However, what if some critical mass of families decided that they were going to commit to sending their children to public schools and become heavily involved in improving the schools? 

I believe if a sizable population of the upper-middle class families of Hoboken start to choose to send their children to public school instead of sending them to private school or leave Hoboken all-together, you will start seeing changes in the public schools: better test scores, more active parental involvement, more accountability on teachers and administrators to provide a first-class education, more AP classes, more extra-curricular activities, etc. And this change would not just benefit the kids coming from upper-middle class backgrounds — this change would improve the quality of education for kids of *all* economic backgrounds.

I sincerely believe we have an opportunity to improve the public school system simply by choosing to enroll our children there and become actively involved in the community life of the school. I believe, as parents, we have a responsibility not just to our own children but to all the children of Hoboken. Choosing to opt out of the public education system is in the end, a selfish choice, which has no possibility of helping other children in the community. Is it wrong to be selfish? Perhaps not. And I’m fully aware that I make plenty of selfish choices to the detriment of others around me. The schooling issue is tough for a lot of people, whereas for me, it’s not as difficult because I grew up attending urban public schools. I just believe we have an enormous opportunity to make a significant impact in one of our most important social institutions and in the lives of all the children in our community.
