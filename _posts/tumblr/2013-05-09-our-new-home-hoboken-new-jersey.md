As many of you know, we spent much of the beginning of this year stressed out by our apartment hunt. I’ve been busy, frustrated, angry, sad, etc. as I’ve come to the realization that we wouldn’t be staying in New York City and Queens in particular. We spent a grueling 3 months looking at neighborhoods all over the place and we feel at peace with our new home in Hoboken, New Jersey.

*"You couldn’t find a place to live in Queens!?!?"*

When one of my wife’s friends’ husband heard that we couldn’t find a place to live in Queens, apparently he responded incredulously “They couldn’t find a place to live in all of Queens?!? That they had to move to New Jersey?!?!” or something to that effect. In a borough which would be the fourth largest city in America if NYC boroughs were independent cities, how could it be so difficult to find an apartment? The truth is that if we were just looking for a roof over our heads, sure, we could have found some apartment somewhere in Queens. However, we had a list of ‘requirements’ and a vision of what we wanted our lives to look like that we couldn’t match up with anything we saw in Queens:

* 2 or 3 bedrooms, larger than 900 square feet
* Dishwasher or laundry-in-building
* No walk-ups, unless it was a first floor unit
* Rent less than $3000 per month
* Good restaurants, shops and essential services within walking distance
* Green space and playgrounds within walking distance
* Less than 45 minute commute to midtown Manhattan

We looked at apartments in Astoria, Long Island City, Sunnyside, and Forest Hills. We saw some apartments that came close to meeting our list of requirements but none that quite met all of them. People kept telling us that we couldn’t find an apartment that had everything we wanted but I didn’t accept that.

*Brooklyn or Manhattan?*

When we couldn’t find what we wanted in Queens (which I always believed to provide the best value in terms of apartments), we started looking at the other boroughs to see if we could find some other way to stay in NYC proper. We considered Greenpoint, Windsor Terrace, Carroll Gardens in Brooklyn. Also looked at the Upper East Side and Washington Heights in Manhattan. With many of these neighborhoods, we had to consider maybe getting rid of our car in order to be able to afford the rent (especially if we wanted a place like the UES or Carroll Gardens to work out).

We actually put in an application on an apartment in “Hudson Heights” which is the more gentrified northern portion of Washington Heights but got cold feet and decided to not go through with signing the lease. The neighborhood is great — very safe, family-friendly with beautiful parks/playgrounds including the amazing Fort Tryon Park and the Cloisters, quiet, beautiful old art-deco era buildings, decent public schools, etc. And the apartment was *huge* — 1200 square feet. But there were little things that would not have given us exactly what we wanted with our life there — it had a small refrigerator (which had been a real pain with our last apartment), parking would have been a pain, building was kinda old and dirty (not one of the nice art-deco buildings). Maybe these were irrational reasons to not live there but overall, it felt like it would have been a downgrade from our life in Astoria.

*New Jersey? Really?!?*

I used to have the same misconceptions about New Jersey that everyone else has. Or maybe I still do. For the most part, I think most of New Jersey is not where I want to raise my family, primarily because I have a philosophical opposition to the suburban way of life and all its implications on pretty much every aspect of society. But If there was any place in New Jersey where I could live that wouldn’t place me at odds with my ideals, it’d be Hoboken.

I didn’t know Hoboken very well when we started this apartment search and honestly, I don’t even remember why I started considering it — maybe it was out of desperation as our time and options were running out. My impression of Hoboken was the same as most people’s — that it was full of heavy-drinking 20-somethings who for one reason or another, couldn’t handle living in NYC proper. However, as I read more about Hoboken, I started reading about how it was becoming quite family-friendly, had a lot of character and personality, and was very pedestrian-friendly. I also always thought it was out of our price range for some reason but maybe that’s a reflection of how much faster NYC rents have gone up.

We visited Hoboken 2 or 3 weekends in a row, doing a combination of exploring the town and looking at apartments. It was such a huge difference in experience — realtors weren’t as pushy, we were finding a lot more apartments that met our criteria (it’s nice actually having options!) and we thought Hoboken itself was really nice. We finally reached our drop-dead date, 3 weeks before being kicked our of our apartment when we decided to sign a lease on an apartment in uptown Hoboken.

*Hoboken: so far, so good*

It’s been almost two weeks in Hoboken. There are certainly things we miss about living in Queens and Astoria in particular but for the most part, I’m very happy with the decision we made. Highlights so far:
* Easier and faster commute: only 25 minutes door-to-door to work via NJ Transit bus
* 2-3 amazing parks/playgrounds within 5-10 minute walking distance
* Beautiful waterfront area with nice views of Manhattan within a 10 minute walk from our apartment
* Best cannolis I’ve ever had (http://www.yelp.com/biz/giorgios-italian-and-french-pastry-shop-hoboken)
* Mamoun’s Falafel in Hoboken! Free delivery! And yes, it’s just as good as the Manhattan locations.
* Washer/dryer in-unit allows us to do laundry at all times of the day/night without leaving the apartment. Makes it easier to go back to using cloth diapers for our 8 month old.
* Giving Raf a bedroom large enough that he can actually play in
* HUGE grocery store (ShopRite) within 10 minute walk from apartment that’s 10-25% cheaper than your typical Queens grocery store
* Full size appliances (refrigerator, oven, dishwasher)!
* Peace and quiet. No police car, ambulance, and fire truck sirens blaring constantly through the day and night up and down 21st Street.

We’ve discovered that Hoboken is not just full of 20-somethings stumbling around the city drunk. Or maybe it is on weekends and evenings. But as a parent of two young kids, I don’t go out after 8pm anymore so I never see that scene. In the mornings and during the daytime, the city actually feels overrun by moms and dads pushing their young kids around in strollers.

For growing families of 2 or more kids who feel the space and price pressure of living in New York City — I would highly recommend taking a look at Hoboken. It’s not for everyone and it’s certainly not cheap but if you’re able to spend $2500 or more per month, it’s a much better value than what you can get renting in NYC, without giving up a lot of what makes city living so great and gaining a lot of amenities and conveniences that make life a little bit more pleasant.
