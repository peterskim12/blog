Perhaps we don’t like to think that churches target their services and programs to a specific demographic or preference, but regardless of whether they are intentional about it or not, it happens.

If you look at the wide variety of news magazines available on a typical newsstand, each of them appeal to a different subset of the population. Some of those subsets overlap, some don’t. For example, magazines like Newsweek and Time probably aim for the broadest swath of the reading public. As a result, they design their magazines and publish content that tries to appeal to as many people as possible — they tend to include larger and more images and target a lower reading comprehension level than other magazines. However, other news magazines such as The Economist and The Atlantic make an intentional appeal for a more educated and wealthier target audience. The stories are a bit more in-depth and are written at a higher reading comprehension level. You can just tell from comparing the advertisements between Time and The Economist who they think their readers are.

What does this have to do with church? A major part of any church’s mission is to communicate a message and it’s important to recognize that how the message is communicated influences the type of people who will be drawn to your message and to your church. A church has to decide whether their sermons are going to consist of content that’s more like Time, The Economist, People, or Sports Illustrated — none of those “styles” would be bad but a church should be honest with what demographic of people they are primarily targeting and deliver a relevant message. It would be dishonest to say that you want your church to be open to people from all educational and cultural backgrounds while preaching sermons that feel like they come out of The Economist. A church would also have to realize that delivering sermons at the level of Time magazine would turn off people who want an Economist-level message.

While some people are disheartened by what they perceive to be “division” in the church by seeing so many different kinds on churches out there, I see this as a positive development in the church as a whole. We live in a society that is more and more stratified by race, wealth, culture, etc., and while we long for the day when people from all backgrounds will worship God as one, our humanness requires that we communicate Jesus in a way that is receptive to the wide variety of levels in which people communicate today. I think churches should also be more open to offering services and programs that target different groups — for example having a single church offer a 9am liturgical service, 11am rock-music-style service, a 5pm academic/lecture-style service, and a 7pm experiential prayer service. How awesome would that be?
