About a week ago, one of the halogen bulbs in the recessed lighting in my living room died. The easy decision at this point would have been to just get a new halogen light bulb to replace the dead one. $8 expense and I’m done. 

However, if you know me, no decision comes that easy. I certainly consider myself to be pragmatic but I’d also like to believe that I comprehensively weigh all my options before even making the smallest decision because as with a decision like changing a light bulb, it often has medium to short term consequences. In this case, if I was hoping to go all LED in the future anyways, I should consider at least starting now. Even though the upfront costs would obviously be higher with going LED, maybe it would be cheaper in the long run. 

Instead of thinking about changing out all my recessed lighting (I only have 6 total), I moved one of the good bulbs from my kitchen to replace the dead one in the living room, then decided to put LEDs in the 2 kitchen recessed lighting cans. 

First decision: color temperature. The convention is to use “soft white” 2700K lights in living spaces such as the living room, bedrooms, etc. Kitchens are sometimes included in that recommendation; if not, 3000K lights are recommended for the kitchen. I personally don’t like the yellowish tone of the 2700K and 3000K lights, so I decided to go against convention and get 5000K lights.

Second decision: shape/size. Part of the problem with the decision to go 5000K is that light bulb companies don’t seem to sell them in the BR40 size/shape, so I had to go with some PAR38 bulbs from Philips, which are about the same size but don’t have the same dispersion qualities that the BR40 does. I considered some 5000K LEDs from Ecosmart but their warranty was only 3 years compared to Philips’ 6 year warranty.

Next problem: LED-compatible dimmer switch. My old dimmer switch would not have worked with the LEDs, so I had to get a new dimmer switch. And since the dimmer switch is in a 2-gang box with another switch and I’m in the process of changing out all my conventional light switches with more modern ones, it made sense to upgrade that other switch too.

In the end, total cost of changing my kitchen lighting was $132 compared to $8 if I just changed the bulb. However, if you compare costs over a 6 year time horizon, they end up being about the same and the LEDs start becoming cheaper if they last longer then 6 years.

Trying to be “eco-conscious” isn’t always easy and does cost more upfront. But at this point, even if costs are the same over the long term, I’d rather suck it up and invest in eco-friendly technology since I’d rather spend the money on the switches/bulbs than paying more to the power company. 

Wish list: can Philips, Ecosmart, Cree, etc. please start selling some BR40 5000K LED light bulbs?
