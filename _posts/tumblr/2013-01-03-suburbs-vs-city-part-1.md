In general, the philosophy of city people is that Life (capitalization is intentional) happens outside the home whereas suburban people believe Life happens inside the home. Much of the latter seems to be driven by fear of the unknown and losing control of your environment which is understandable if you follow the news. But I think there is so much that we miss out on when we choose to not engage in public space. 

I want a family that engages with the world in all its goodness AND brokenness because I believe that is the example that Christ set for us. The incarnation is at its core a decision to move from private to public, from comfort to discomfort, from focus on self to others. 

Sure, there are plenty of suburban people who have rich social lives and engage with the world around them and city folk who lead very private lives. However I believe the urban environment inherently pushes people to live more public lives and this is why I choose to raise my kids in the city.
