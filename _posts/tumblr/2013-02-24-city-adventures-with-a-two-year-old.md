Occasionally, my 2.5 year old son, Rafael, and I go out with no particular destination in mind to give the wife some space and peace/quiet. Today, we actually did have an objective but ended up going on a grand tour of Astoria.

As you probably know from our last post, we’re in the midst of an apartment hunt. I already have two real estate agents on the lookout for an apartment for us, but I figured it wouldn’t hurt to get one or two more involved. There’s a place on 30th Ave in Astoria that gets good reviews on Yelp, so I decided to pay them a visit.

We hopped on the Q100 bus which stops in front of our apartment building and took it just a few blocks north to 30th Ave. Then, we walked all the way from 21st St and 30th Ave to 35th St. where the realtor’s office is. Had a pleasant and hopeful conversation with an agent there who seemed pretty confident that he could get us what we were looking for. At that point, I gave Raf a choice of going to Steinway or on the train. He’s been asking to go to Steinway lately because he remembers the wife taking him to a Starbucks there and getting him a bottle of milk (which I think was a novelty for him).

So we walked over to Steinway, then walked south to Ricky’s. Ricky’s is one of my favorite NYC stores. It’s a cleaner, trendier version of Sally’s Beauty Supply. After that, we stopped by Queens Kickshaw, which is one of my favorite coffee places in New York City. They are one of the growing number of coffee shops doing pour over. This also served as a bathroom break for Raf. We’re in the middle of potty training him and he’s been pretty good with not having accidents when we’re out and about. We sat down in the front area of Queens Kickshaw, got myself a pour over and a sticky bun that I shared with Raf. 

I thought we were going to head home at this point, but then as we got to the N train tracks, he insisted on going on the train, so I relented and we got on the N train towards Ditmars, which was just 3 stops away. We got off, walked a few blocks to the Q69 bus stop and had to wait for a while. I’m glad that 2 year olds are pretty good with finding a way to keep themselves entertained, even when waiting for a bus running on Sunday schedule. We hopped in and out of a square patch of dirt for what felt like forever, which kept him amused while we waited.

Although I mentioned looking outside of Astoria for our apartment hunt, our adventure today reminded me of how much I love living in Astoria. It’s just the right mix of not being completely gentrified (still has a lot of family-owned, usually Greek, businesses), while being gentrified enough to satisfy my admittedly yuppie preferences. The Ditmars end is quiet and very family-oriented but all the great restaurants and cafes you’d ever want to go to are just a couple of train stops away on 30th Ave and Broadway. Anyway, I know it’s not for everyone but it works for us and I really do hope that we’ll be able to find the right apartment for us in Astoria.
