I got my Warby Parkers and unfortunately I’ll be returning them. For normal eyeglasses, they only offer high-index lenses at 1.67. For sunglasses, they don’t offer high-index lenses at all. I asked them about both — they said their business model is based on keeping things simple, which necessarily excludes serving the needs of a subset of their potential customer base.

I decided to try ordering them anyways since they have a 30-day money back guarantee. It turns out that even the 1.67 high-index lenses are too thick for my prescription. The thickness really affects the way the eyeglasses look, not just from the side but also from the front. Most conventional opticians offer a 1.74 high-index lens (which is what I have in my current eyeglasses) and they’re great. Bottom line is that if your prescription is worse than about -6 (mine is around -8), I wouldn’t bother with getting Warby Parkers.

I wish Warby Parker would advise customers against ordering prescription glasses from them if the prescription is fairly strong but I guess there are cost-conscious customers out there who may not mind the thick lenses. Prescription eyeglasses with the high-index lenses will cost about $175 from Warby Parker (included frames and lenses), which is a great deal. If I didn’t have vision insurance, my current eyeglasses with ProDesign frames + 1.74 high-index lenses would probably cost around $500-600. I hope Warby Parker offers the 1.74 high-index lenses some day — even if they had to add a $150 surcharge for the super high-index, they’d still be a great deal.
