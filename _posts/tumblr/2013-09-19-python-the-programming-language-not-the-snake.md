I enjoy coding in Python. I’m not a Python guru by any means. My first exposure to it was 2 jobs ago when I was given some Python scripts to maintain. At the time, I only knew Java and found the lack of type/class declaration required on every variable and function/method a bit too loosy-goosy. Also, I’ve always run into issues with string encodings in Python; though I hear that’s gotten better in Python 3.

In my current job, there have been a few instances where I needed to write something relatively quick and dirty. I didn’t want to deal with having to compile it but also wanted to make it readable/maintainable in case someone were to re-use it in the future.

The three best/most popular choices for this sort of use case are:

* Ruby
* Python
* Perl

I’ve tried learning Ruby a number of times. I bought a couple books, made some enhancements to software written in Ruby… but just never have enjoyed working with Ruby. I find the syntax to be a little too different from the languages I’m used to working with… I’m not enough of a programming language geek to be able to confidently make the statement that Ruby’s syntax is “bad” but I’m generally pretty good at learning new things and Ruby just hasn’t clicked with me for some reason.

Perl… I used Perl a lot in my last job but that was primarily because certain people on the engineering team liked Perl and bundled Perl along with the software distribution. It’s just easier to not have to tell the customer to install Ruby or Python separately on all their servers so I ended up writing Perl scripts. I’m sure it’s possible to write maintainable and readable Perl code but there seems to be this attitude amongst Perl aficionados where they actually take pride in being able to write code as concisely as possible, without regard for maintainability.

Which leaves Python… besides the pain with working with encodings, I’ve generally had a very pleasant experience writing Python code. I feel like it’s a very productive language which provides just enough structure and rules without being too rigid and verbose.
