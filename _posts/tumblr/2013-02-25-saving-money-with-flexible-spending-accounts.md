Whenever we enter the annual benefits enrollment period, my colleagues often say that they don’t enroll in the flexible spending account. Medical FSA accounts are use it or lose it, so they’re concerned they’ll be throwing away money.

This is kind of a silly excuse. You can always put some amount of money that you’ll be highly likely to spend per year. If you wear glasses/contact lenses, have a plan with a deductible or co-insurance component, and/or have kids, you will likely spend at least $250 a year on medical expenses. Depending on your marginal tax rate, you can save 20-30% on your medical expenses.

This especially works out when you know you’ll be having a child in the coming year. I have a medical plan with a co-insurance component. I knew I would definitely be spending around $3000 for the birth of my son last year, eye exams for the wife and I, etc., so that’s how much we set aside in our FSA. We ended up using all of it, so that was a savings of $750!

This year, I decided to set aside $2500 in our FSA. That was a bit aggressive but we knew our older son would require some minor medical procedures, we’d need new contact lenses, etc. Same applies to public transit FSAs. I spend about $100 per month on public transportation expenses, so with the FSA, I save about $300. In total, I’ll save about $925 this year from using both my medical and public transport FSAs.
