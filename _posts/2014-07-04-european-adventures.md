I went to Amsterdam for 6 days last week. I recently started a new job at Elasticsearch. The company has a distributed model, I guess similar to [37signals](http://signalvnoise.com/posts/3064-stop-whining-and-start-hiring-remote-workers) which is what my neighbor mentioned when I said Elasticsearch hires the best people for the job, regardless of location.

That being said, there is value in regularly gathering people to meet in person so the company has been hosting an all-company meeting in Amsterdam once or twice a year for the past couple of years. 

I hadn't traveled to Europe since 2010, right before we started having kids. I wish I could say we were one of those families that continues to travel even after having kids but throw in a few job changes, moves from New York to DC back to New York then to New Jersey, and there just wasn't a good opportunity to do it. 

Being new to the company, I decided that I'd be a good citizen and try to save the company some money. I don't know what it is with these summer airfares but I was seeing quotes of $2500 for direct flights from New York to Amsterdam! I remember flying from New York to London 4 years ago, even in the summer, for less than $1000, so this was a bit of a shock. Anyway, I did a little bit more digging around and discovered that flying into Amsterdam is expensive for some reason, so I looked at quotes to fly into nearby cities and found that flights into Brussels were $700 cheaper! Tack on a 1 hr 45 minute train ride for less than $200 and I come out saving the company ~$500. Also, I thought it'd be nice to visit Brussels in addition to Amsterdam -- though admittedly I'm not a fan of Brussels. I found Bruges to be much more interesting when we visited 4 years ago.

*Arriving at Brussels Airport*

I enjoy the challenge of figuring out transport systems, payment methods, etc. in foreign countries so I had fun seeing if I could smoothly go from the airport to central city train station in Brussels onto a train to Amsterdam then to my company's office via Amsterdam's public transport -- all while not asking anyone for help. 

First step: figure out which train to take from Brussels Airport to Bruxelles-Midi train station and buy the appropriate ticket. There weren't any English train schedules and this is complicated by the fact that the station is referred to as Brussel-Zuid (Dutch) and Bruxelles-Midi (French). I also hadn't had the opportunity to visit an ATM yet and wasn't sure if my American credit card would work at the ticket machine.

*Hope this is the right one...*

Fortunately, my UNFCU Chip and PIN credit card worked as expected and I hopped on a train that I had about 80% certainty was the right train, despite my lack of knowledge of Dutch/French. About twenty minutes later, I was at my intended destination!

*Whew, made it to Bruxelles-Midi!*

I hopped on a Thalys "high-speed" train from Brussels to Amsterdam. You never know who you're going to sit next to when you travel. Usually I don't sit next to anyone particularly interesting when flying within the US but on this train ride, I started talking to the guy sitting next to me and it turns out he's one of the world's experts on the use of carbon fiber helicopter blades.

*Arrival at Amsterdam Centraal*

Once I got to Amsterdam, I could have taken the easy way out and hailed a cab to go to my company's office but taking the tram wasn't too difficult. Getting an "anonymous" OV-chipkaart is probably the best way to go for most tourists.

Unfortunately, I didn't have a whole lot of time to explore Amsterdam due to the packed schedule my company had put together for the week but I did try to wake up early each day and take some nice walks around the city. 

I made sure to get one decent cup of coffee while I was there:
