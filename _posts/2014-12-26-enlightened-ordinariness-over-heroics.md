title: An Enlightened Ordinariness over Heroics
tags: [life]

We live in a world where people yearn for heroes. Super hero movies are more popular than ever. Companies are looking to hire "rock stars" and celebrate employees who go far beyond their expected duty. Our sensationalist news media and short-attention-span-oriented social media doesn't have the bandwidth to promote anything that doesn't seem to be exceptional in nature. 

It's unfortunate because the vast majority of human beings are completely ordinary people (at least in the eyes of the powers that be) who will never engage in anything 'heroic' or newsworthy. It's unfortunate because I firmly believe that there is great potential for ordinary people to cause revolutionary change in the world by making incremental, yet intentional decisions for good. 

Instead of giving into the notion that my actions won't make a difference, what if we started asking ourselves what our world would look like if a few hundred or thousand or even millions of other people made the same intentional decision for good? 

* What if that many more people spent an extra 5 minutes a week sorting out recycling the way I do? 
* What if that many more people set their thermostat a few degrees off to save energy? 
* What if that many more people exchanged an hour a week of watching TV with reading a book or a newspaper?

It's tempting to think our own actions don't matter. I believe the way we choose to live our lives matter. It has an impact both on us personally and also the world far beyond us. Let's stop looking to "heroes" to fix the world's problems and ask just a little bit more from ordinary people like ourselves.
