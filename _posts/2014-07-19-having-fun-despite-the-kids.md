title: Having fun "despite" the kids

Having kids is great. No regrets at all. There are lots of good and bad reasons to have kids. Don't have kids because that's what you're "supposed" to do in life. But at the same time, don't be afraid of how having kids will change your life. It's perfectly fine if you decide not to have kids but I think it's a major cop-out to not have kids because of fear -- whether that's fear of the unknown, fear of having to modify your career or life goals, etc.

Anyways, with kids, it can be really easy to get bogged down with the day-to-day *stuff* that just needs to get done. Everything now seems like a major ordeal -- washing up in the morning, bathing, eating, going to the bathroom, etc. Also, some parents feel like they constantly need to entertain their kids, so they're constantly running around taking the kids to the park, to different classes or activities, etc. I don't think that's healthy -- we need to find a way to retain activities or hobbies that give us fulfillment, as adults. But there's also an unhealthy way of erring to the other side where we feel like our "adult-time" has to be completely independent of "kid-time". 

There are certainly "adult" activities that are inherently impossible to participate in with the children... like going to loud rock concerts where the headlining act doesn't get on stage until midnight. I certainly miss doing that. But for the most part, I think I've found ways to bring adult-level contentment and meaning into activities that *include* the kids. And that's what I continue to strive for instead of having clear separation of all activities either being primarily meaningful for the kids vs for the adults. 

Last weekend, we went to Day Out with Thomas with 3 other families. It was chaotic — I will not deny that. I organized the day so that we spend some time doing all the Thomas stuff, then we went to a nice gastropub where we could have our tasty adult beverages while also feeding the kids. It was nice because I found satisfaction in the joy that my kids and their friends were experiencing... but I didn't completely dismiss my own needs which is why I mixed in the lunch at the nice gastropub. 

We do a lot of other things as a family where we try to incorporate things that are satisfying for all of us and while it can sometimes feel as though it's not as satisfying as if we did them independently, there is also the added joy that we can experience these things that we enjoy *together* as a family. 

We had dinner last night at Mamoun's and as we were walking there, my older son Rafael commented "Mamoun's is the best!" And as we partook in the glorious tastiness that is Mamoun's, I thought to myself that there's nothing better than sitting here  sharing this thing that I had previously enjoyed so much on my own — but now, as a family.
