I'm fortunate to work in the technology sector where for many roles, all you really need is a computer and internet connection to be able to work productively. However, most companies still seem to require their employees to come into the office. Most tech companies I know of do seem to allow working from home but generally either on an infrequent basis (e.g. 1 day per week) and/or for special circumstances (e.g. expecting furniture delivery).

We can debate the usual arguments back and forth regarding whether people can be effective working from home; that's not what I want to cover in this blog post though (sorry, the image above is a bit misleading). My assumption is that we're talking about a company that treats its employees as adults and there's a high level of mutual respect and accountability. 

What I'd like to propose is that if more companies hire people with the assumption that they can freely work from home and are never required to come into an office, this can literally change the world. I think the technology sector has the opportunity to be this catalyst for change. 

Jeff Atwood, formerly of Stack Exchange, published a blog post back in 2010 talking about how Stack Exchange decided to embrace remote work as a first class work option:

Stack Exchange wrote about it again in 2013, this time on their blog, to say that they still believe in remote work:

These posts focus mostly on how remote work allows them to hire the smartest people they can find and not be restricted to where the company's offices are located. It's the reason why [Elastic](http://www.elastic.co), my current employer, has a mostly distributed engineering organization -- being an open source company, we want to hire the top contributors to our projects, wherever they are located, and not force them to relocate in order to work for a company they love. 

I'd like to suggest that building companies assuming a remote workforce has impact far beyond simply improving the quality of the workforce, specifically addressing these key social issues:

* Gentrification
* Climate change
* Family life

# How remote work addresses the problem of gentrification

I was just in San Francisco and South Bay for about 10 days. As someone who's lived primarily in the Midwest and East Coast, it's a bit wild to see a place like the Bay Area where technology is the dominant industry. In an economy where tech company valuations are shooting through the roof while other industries are experiencing much slower growth, it'd be naive to think that San Francisco and the Bay Area is not going to experience significant change as a result.

A strong anti-tech sentiment has been developing in the Bay Area from those who aren't directly reaping the benefits of the tech boom. And from their perspective, it's understandable why one would be upset at seeing your neighborhood and city completely change from newcomers moving in, driving up rents and home values, and eventually forcing people to move out because they can't afford to live in the city they've called home their entire lives.

I would argue that in the end, this extreme escalation in cost of living really makes no one happy, except those who are the top beneficiaries of the tech boom. Those who moderately benefit -- perhaps people working in non-core roles at tech companies, less successful tech companies, companies with auxiliary relationships with tech, etc -- are unhappy from 1) being forced to work in a high cost area like the SF Bay Area but 2) not being able to have the lifestyle they'd ideally want since everything is so damn expensive. 

The ironic thing is that the industry driving the skyrocketing cost of living in the Bay Area is the one most able to support a remote workforce. What if 10%, 25% or 50% of the tech companies based in the Bay Area told their employees tomorrow that they can work from any location in the world? I'm sure you'll have a significant number of people saying, "You mean I don't have to pay $5000 a month in rent for my crappy apartment anymore? Goodbye SF!" This would significantly relieve the pressure on housing in the Bay Area and slow down the pace of gentrification. I've seen this happen at Elastic where a number of my colleagues, soon after starting their jobs, decided to pack up and move elsewhere. 

Of course, San Francisco is not the only metropolitan area experiencing significant gentrification: New York, Boston, Washington, DC, Los Angeles -- basically every major metropolis in America and probably the world, are struggling with the issue of gentrification. Also, it's not just the major population centers that will reap the benefits of non-locale-dependent work. Cities with depressed economies such as Detroit and regions with perpetually lagging economies such as parts of the Southeast and Plains states will benefit from remote tech workers injecting money into their local economies.

One of my major reasons for choosing to live here despite the high cost of living is the diversity and sheer size of the economy. There is no other city in America and perhaps the world where I'd have the same level of confidence that I could always find *some* work to do that I at least find somewhat interesting. This statement would not be true in other cities that have far less diverse economies. While I love living in the New York metro area and Hoboken in particular, if I knew I could always find a job working remotely, I might be living somewhere else that has a lower cost of living. 

# How remote work addresses climate change

It boggles my mind that people in many ciies spend an hour or more commuting each way every day. That's 2+ hours of completely wasted time. Sure, you could pass the time by reading a book, listening to podcasts, etc. But wouldn't you rather choose to do those activities in comfort of your own home or during a walk with your dog in your neighborhood instead of sitting in a car in traffic?

The majority of these commuters are making this commute in automobiles. And the majority of the drivers during rush hour commutes are driving by themselves. Inefficiency on top of inefficiency on top of more inefficiency. 

What if we could take a lot of those cars off the road during rush hour? How much fewer greenhouse gases would we be emitting into our atmostphere? How many lives would be saved due to the reductions in auto accident fatalities? How much time would be saved, not just from the people not having to commute, but also by the reduced time spent in traffic for those who do have to commute? How much less fossil fuels would we need to pump and consume if most of our driving was for running errands rather than commuting to/from work?

# How remote work impacts family life

I'm a parent to two young children. I'm extremely fortunate to be able to *choose* to have my children be with either me or my wife the vast majority of the time. It's unfortunate when families who ideally would want either or both parents to just be able to see their children for more than an hour in the morning and an hour in the evening (if that!) don't feel like they have any options besides having one parent stay home full time. Remote work allows parents who want to be more physically present in their childrens' lives to see their kids throughout the day while not giving up on their career or financial goals.

# Conclusion

There are many more benefits to be reaped if we lived in a world where remote work was the norm or even just widely accepted. Someone getting their Master's Degree in Organizational Behavior could/should write a thesis on this. Hopefully, this starts helping people understand why I am such a strong proponent of remote work. If remote work were just about being able to hire from a broader pool of talent, I wouldn't really care that much. It's the broader social implications of remote work which really get me excited and hopeful.
