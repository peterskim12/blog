This blog isn't really new. I've migrated most of my blog posts from my old Tumblr site into this new [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)-powered blog hosted on [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/). 

I wish I knew about Jekyll earlier. I used to pay almost $100 a year to host my dad's really basic website that consists of just 1 static HTML page. I learned that you can use Amazon S3 for [really cheap static web hosting](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html) so now I only pay about $13 a year. That got me thinking that it'd be nice if my blog just consisted of static HTML files that I could host via S3 instead of needing a full-blown hosting service that can run Wordpress along with all of its dependencies (e.g. database, PHP, etc.). 

This is where Jekyll comes in. What is Jekyll? From their website:

> Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through Markdown (or Textile) and Liquid converters, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favorite web server.

Exactly what I was looking for. We'll give this a shot and see where it goes.
