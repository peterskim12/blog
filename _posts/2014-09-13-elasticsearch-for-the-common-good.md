In case you don't know me well, my day job is being a Sales Engineer at [Elasticsearch](http://www.elasticsearch.com). If you're not familiar with the world of software sales, this means I help prospective customers figure out if Elasticsearch is the right product to solve the problems they're encountering with managing and analyzing their data. 

This is my first time working at an open-source software company, so coming into this job, I wasn't sure if there would be a meaningful difference between this experience compared to previous ones working at closed-source, proprietary software companies. Four months into the job, I have to say that there certainly is a difference.

Just this past week, we announced 1) [a public GitHub repository](http://www.elasticsearch.org/blog/bring-your-own-demo/) for Elasticsearch demos and 2) [our first demo](http://www.elasticsearch.org/blog/byodemos-new-york-city-traffic-incidents/) -- utilizing Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana to analyze NYC traffic accident data. During my first week at Elasticsearch, I needed to get up to speed with learning how to use the three products that make up "the ELK stack". I had just come across the [NYC Big Apps](http://nycbigapps.com/) competition and noticed one of their featured data sets was one of [traffic accident data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/NYC-BigApps/NYPD-Motor-Vehicle-Collisions/h9gi-nx95?) from the New York City Police Department. One of the [major policy initiatives](http://www.nyc.gov/html/visionzero/pages/home/home.html) of the new mayor of New York City, Bill de Blasio, is to find ways to reduce the number of traffic fatalities. In about a day's time, with no prior experience using Elasticsearch, Logstash or Kibana, I was able to process this data set and immediately start discovering interesting insights in the data. 

From this experience, I was convinced of the potential of the ELK stack to not just address challenging business needs such as being alerted of application errors and service outages, identifying network security threats, and helping users find relevant documents via full-text search -- but also to help solve some of our society's most significant problems. 

* In addition to being able to monitoring critical applications for the top financial services companies in the world, what if the ELK stack could be used to monitor the proper functioning of water systems in third-world countries and provide real-time alerts to ensure people have access to clean water?
* In addition to helping employees of large multi-national corporations search their entire intranet to find relevant information to drive business decisions, what if the ELK stack could be used to provide an interactive information discovery tool for trial data for experimental drugs that may cure a disease for which there is currently no cure?

Now, I come back to my question of whether working at an open-source company would be different from a proprietary software company. One difference is that with open source software, governments and non-profit organizations now have access to the same tool that large corporations use to solve their data problems. When I've worked at proprietary software companies in the past, there have certainly been efforts to convince the executive leadership to consent to "donating" software licenses to good causes but there's *always* some catch. Can the company get a tax writeoff for this donation? How can the company maximize the PR benefits of this action? How does the company decide which "good" causes to donate to?

Knowing that my contributions to Elasticsearch, the open-source project and the company, can make an impact on the ills of our society, in addition to help businesses be more productive, gives me significantly more motivation to come to work every day and put in my best effort than if it was purely about monetary profit. Also, being on a team where everyone shares that sentiment makes the sense of comraderie notably different from that developed from people finding solace in one another in having to deal with a sucky work environment or purely from social connections made over a foosball table and free lunches.

Elasticsearch has a [large number of open job reqs](http://www.elasticsearch.com/about/careers/) across all of our groups. If you've got the chops and the motivation to be a part of something amazing, we'd love to have you on the team!
